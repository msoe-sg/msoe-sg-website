     Hi! I'm Ashley, a Senior Civil Engineering Student. Along with Student Government, I am also a part of three other groups on campus. 
     These include Society of Women Engineers, where I am the Treasurer, Institute of Transportation Engineers, where I am the founder and President, 
     and I am a CAECM Career Night Co-Chair. I enjoy reading, running, and watching movies/shows. I am the Mega- Meeting Chair on the Student Government 
     board and my goal of this is to bring information to different organizations to help them connect with more students on campus.

     I am Cameron Carpenter, a sophomore majoring in Computer Engineering from Green Bay, Wisconsin.
     I have had the honor of representing the MSOE student body as a senator of our Student Government over the past school year.
     I have never been afraid to voice my opinion or the opinion of others in the effort to make sure all perspectives are heard on any given topic.
     I am currently on the Semester Conversion Steering Committee to ensure that students have a voice in the implementation of the new academic calendar.

     Hi! I'm pretty sure you may have seen me around on campus!
     I’m Geovani Culloton but call me Geo! I am currently a Junior User experience and communication Design Senator. 
     I have been an active general body member of Student Union Board and Society of Hispanic professional engineers. 
     I am currently apart of the computer user Committee and the Vice President of The national society of black engineers.
     I plan to work with the great student body that will be living off campus to still have a great community and help adjust to the growing new changes on campus.
     I believe I can accomplish this by my connections through student organizations here on campus, work ethic, community connections and communication skills.
     I would like to work as a voice of many on the student government board.
     Uniting the voice of both LGBTQ+ students and minority students together as all voices should equally matter here in the very much close-knit community here at MSOE. 
     By working together, we can accomplish great things. Thank you!
