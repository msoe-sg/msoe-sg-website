For the 2020-2021 academic year, our agenda is to lead the Student Government Association (SGA) to a direction that has its core principle on the health and safety students as well as ensuring the voice of the students is heard, and their needs addressed. Additionally, we will continue to have SGA build a stronger relationship among the administration, the faculty and the students here at MSOE. Our ambition for this academic year is to begin a tradition among the faculty senate and the student senate by holding at least one joint senate session a trimester.

We also plan on connecting with and have reoccurring meetings with student organizations that have deep roots within the student community. Alongside our ambitions for the year we also intend to advocate for food, housing and student concerns as well as advocating for facility improvements. Throughout the year it is our intention to propose a relocation of the spirit rock to a more desirable location that better showcases student life on campus, a fixture of the steps leading into the Tod Wehr conference center by Highland Ave and Broadway to the national standard of step height and width, and to propose an increase the hours of operation of the library for the week prior to finals week. 

Within SGA itself, we plan on reforming it to best help the students and student organizations while we continue to clash with the COVID-19 pandemic. Our aim is to shuffle the Student Government Budget and increase the Student Government outreach to students and student organizations throughout the academic year. But most importantly, our goal will always have SGA actively listen, comment and voice any to all student concerns.
